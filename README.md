# UltimateSoccerNFT
This is back for UltimateSoccerNFT project and some front


Use generatePlayer.js to generate json for metadata and set an image to every id, after upload jpg to ipfs set new cid to metadata with update.mjs, this will give you one new json for metadata with ipfs jpg.

There are 2 contracts, one simple erc20 and erc721 simplificated with roles, very usable for mint, tansfer, auctions and royalties.

Front is a simple web with a connected metamsk button and mint.

Use npm, react and hardhat to deploy.

Feel free to contact if any help needed.
